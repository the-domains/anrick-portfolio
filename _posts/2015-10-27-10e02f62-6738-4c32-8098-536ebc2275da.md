UNIT9 partnered with Lexus and Team One to create "Elevate," a cinematic VR experience starring Christian Vande Velde, who talks about his love for cycling, his life experiences, and 'why he rides'.

Viewers see the world from Christian's perspective, as he rides through a 360ยบ view of the iconic mountains in Malibu. Using groundbreaking technology and an camera work that is unique in VR cinema, you get a unique and unprecedented perspective of what cycling means to people like Christian.
